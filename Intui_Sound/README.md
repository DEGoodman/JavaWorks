Intui-Sound

This program is a Java/OpenCV based application, currently supported only on Mac OS X. The program changes system volume to more appropriate levels based on the distance of a user from a webcamera. Most webcams, including integrated laptop cameras are supported. To run the application, import the project into any Java IDE, and run the Java class "FaceTracker". The computer will take care of the rest. Java calls one of three Applescripts to change system volume.


All files are open source, and can be modified at the discretion of the user.
